      <p>If you live around the east coast of the United States, you may have seen or heard about spotted lanternflies, an invasive species of insect native to Asia. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the pest was first seen in Pennsylvania in 2014 and has since spread across 14 states, where it has been largely feeding on and damaging grape plants.</p>
      <p>The Spotted Lanternfly is only one of many invasive species, which include any non-native living organisms that cause economic or environmental harm to an ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Here are four ways in which invasive species harming the agricultural industry:</p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="iconcap">The USDA estimates that invasive species have cost North America $26 billion per year since 2010, and economic losses from smaller yields, lower quality harvests and higher control costs are a big part of that cost in the U.S.</p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="iconcap"> Because invasive species tend not to have natural predators or pests in the ecosystems that they invade, their populations can tend to grow uncontrollably. Reliance on pesticides to kill invasive organisms like plants and insects can lead to higher control costs and have harmful environmental consequences.</p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="iconcap"> Invasive insects like spotted lantern flies can directly harm plants and crops. Without natural predators to keep these invasive pests in check, they can over-feed on crops, damaging and killing plants. This leads to smaller yields that make farming less sustainable.</p>

      </div>

      <div>
        <p class="iconcap"> Because invasive plants tend to grow and spread unchecked, they reduce biodiversity and displace native plants that livestock prefer to graze on. Having little food to eat can leave these animals hungry and susceptible to diseases if their diets are not supplemented, which increases the cost of farming.</p>
